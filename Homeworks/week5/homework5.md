## Part A

##### Problem 1:

False - The Rademacher complexity is the hypothesis that most highly correlates with randomness. In a small hypothesis space, it is less likely that there is going to be a hypothesis that matches randomness well, thus normally a smaller **not** larger Rademacher complexity.

##### Problem 2:

False - The VC dimension is defined as the largest set of points that h can shatter. It says nothing about shattering that in an infinite number of ways.

##### Problem 5:

A less common word - Entropy is the measure of the sparsity of a distribution. The less it appears the more sparse its distribution.

##### Problem 6:

The Rademacher Variables is defined as a random variable that either has the value -1 or 1, each with a probability 0.5. It is used to measure a hypothesis against a random hypothesis in measuring Rademacher complexity.

## Part B:

I apologize, I didn't have enough time to complete this part of the assignment. With a bit of research on L2 regularization, it looks like it should increase predictive accuracy, while also increasing the possibility of overfitting. 

## Part C:

Stock Market Predictions Based on News - Use the stock market predictions based on news dataset to predict what is going to happen in the stock market.

Bitcoin predictor - Predict the price of bitcoin based on market trends.
