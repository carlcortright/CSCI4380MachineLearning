\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, I use a K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) model, implemented using scikit-learn and numpy, to classify the MNIST handwriting dataset. I then show how the role of the number of datapoints as well as K contribute to accuracy. Afterwards I analyze which numbers get confused with eachother most easily and compare my model to similar models implemented in Vowpal-Wabbit.

\section{Analysis}

After completing the model, I ran a series of trials comparing the number of training examples with the accuracy while holding k constant. Before running the test I hypothesized that as we gave the model more training examples we would have higher accuracy. By graphing the results it is clear that the accuracy is asymptotically approaching somewhere around 95-96 percent.

% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and 
% Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is slightly modified from 
% Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a lightly 
% changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew Moore, 
% which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and 
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
